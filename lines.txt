-Hello uhm… Rubber Duck!
-There better not be a hidden camera in this.
-She wouldn’t do that to me, would she? 
+She’s mocking me. What kind of anniversary gift is a rubber duck?/She just wants me to succeed in my career. Her programmer friends told her good things about Rubber Duck Debugging.

-Nice, I got shooting to work - first try.
-But I’ve been having trouble getting it to move side by side. 
-I guess this is where you come in, huh Ducky? 
-So my code goes… 
+if(horizontalPressed) position.x + moveAmount;/if (horizontalPressed) position.x += moveAmount
-Oh my god, I’m such an idiot. 
-This is like the simplest thing. 
-(And without you Ducky, I probably would’ve taken twice as long…) 
-Okay deep breaths. Let’s see oh my, the shooting is broken
-That fire rate is CLEARLY overpowered. 
-Let’s see, how can we cripple the player?   
+void update() { reloadCooldown -= Time.time; }/void update () {reloadCooldown -= Time.deltaTime } 
-There! Now they’re just like me! 
-Don’t worry, being a mess is endearing. 
-Or so I’ve been told. 
-Okay, Duck, time to shoot for the stars. Can we-
-One second I gotta take this call. 
-(Yeah of course, don’t worry about it.) 
-(No no no, don’t apologize.)
-(It’s totally fine. We can play Smash some other time.) 
-(Oh he’s gonna teach you? That’s so cool. I hope you two have lots of fun.)  
-(Yeah, I wouldn’t pass up the opportunity to play with a Nintendo Developer either haha.) 
-*ahem* 
-Okay, where were we? 
-Oh yeah, debugging the horizontal movement! 
-The problem’s probably here:
++if(false && veritcalPressed) position.y += moveAmount; if(verticalPressed) position.y += moveAmount/if(veritcalPressed) position.y += moveAmount; if(verticalPressed) position.y += moveAmount
+I can’t compete with him. As a smash player and a partner./They’re just friends. There’s a reason she’s with me. 
++Int numMovementAxis = 1;/int numMovementAxis = 2;
+Did he skip work to be with her? He’s gotta have ulterior motives./He probably just wants to unwind after crunch season.
++dettectMoreKeyes();/detectMoreKeys();
+What does she even see in me? I talk to a Rubber Duck. He talks to Masahiro Sakurai./We tend to be our own worst critic. I’ve gotta be nicer to myself.
-Whew. That took a while.
-But we did it Ducky! We’re on our way!
-Let’s keep it up. Next bug: Sprite Swapping! 
-Let’s see, it goes
