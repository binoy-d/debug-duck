0-Hello uhm… Rubber Duck!
0+She’s mocking me. What kinda anniversary gift is a rubber duck? / She just wants me to do better… by practicing Rubber Duck Debugging.
3-Nice, I got shooting to work - first try.
5-But I’ve been having trouble getting it to move side by side. 
5-I guess this is where you come in, huh Ducky? 
5-So my code goes… 
0+if(horizontalPressed) position.x + moveAmount; / if (horizontalPressed) position.x += moveAmount
5-Oh, I can’t believe I missed that. 
5-This is like the simplest thing. 
5-(And without you Ducky, I probably would’ve taken twice as long…) 
5-Okay deep breaths. Let’s see oh my, the shooting is broken
5-That fire rate is CLEARLY overpowered. 
5-Let’s see, how can we cripple the player?   
6+void update() { reloadCooldown -= Time.time; } / void update () {reloadCooldown -= Time.deltaTime } m,vb
4-Don’t worry, being a mess is endearing. 
4-Or so I’ve been told. 
4-Okay, Duck, time to shoot for the stars. Can we-
4-One second I gotta take this call. 
4-*Yeah of course, don’t worry about it.* 
4-*No no no, don’t apologize.*
4-*It’s totally fine. We can play Smash some other time.* 
4-*Oh he’s gonna teach you? That’s so cool. I hope you two have lots of fun.*  
7-*Yeah, I wouldn’t pass up the opportunity to play with a Nintendo Developer either haha.* 
4-*ahem* 
4-*Okay, where were we? 
4-Oh yeah, debugging the horizontal movement! 
4-The problem’s probably here: 
0+if(false && veritcalPressed) position.y += moveAmount; if(verticalPressed) position.y += moveAmount / if(veritcalPressed) position.y += moveAmount; if(verticalPressed) position.y += moveAmount
2+I can’t compete with him. As a smash player and a partner. / They’re just friends. There’s a reason she’s with me. 
0+int numMovementAxis = 1; / int numMovementAxis = 2;
2+Did he skip work to be with her? He’s gotta have ulterior motives. / He probably just wants to unwind after crunch season.
0+dettectMoreKeyes(); / detectMoreKeys(); 
6+What does she even see in me? I talk to a Rubber Duck. He talks to Masahiro Sakurai. / We tend to be our own worst critic. I’ve gotta be nicer to myself. 
4-Whew. That took a while.
4-But we did it Ducky! We’re on our way!
4-Let’s keep it up. Next bug: Sprite Swapping! 
3-Let’s see, it goes 
6+void OnCatharsis() { spriteRenderer.sprite == trueForm;} / void OnCatharsis() { spriteRenderer.sprite = trueForm;} 
4-Oh boy, looks like that’s not the only thing wrong. 
4-There’s so many bugs everywhere. 
0+If (vulnerabilityAttitude ==  attitudes.ccomfoseat) { OpenUp(); } / If (vulnerabilityAttitude ==  attitudes.comfortable) { OpenUp(); }
0+void Update() { honesty+; } / void Update() { honesty++; } 
6+private insecurity[] insecurities; / public insecurity[] insecurities;
4-Okay, all those typoes are fixed 
4-But for some reason it’s still crashing?
0+while(notGoodEnough) { struggle(); } / while(notGoodEnough) { break; struggle(); }
0+while(notGoodEnough) { struggle(); } / while(notGoodEnough) { break; struggle(); }
2+while(notGoodEnough) { struggle(); } / while(notGoodEnough) { break; struggle(); }
4-Argh, why doesn’t this work?? 
4-I’m gonna take a break and look at my phone, Duck.
5-Forgive me.  
3-Wait...
4-“Thanks to my best friend for the Gold Developer-Edition Nintendo Switch?” 
4-“I can finally get rid of my crappy Switch Lite lol”?? 
2-I got her that Switch Lite… 
5+She doesn’t care about me… / She doesn’t love me. / She’s never loved me. / She’s gonna leave me for me him… / She’s gonna break up with me / She’s gonna cheat on me it’s only a matter of time / I can do this. I have to leave her before she cheats on me. / I’ve gotta cheat on her before she cheats on me. / Okay, okay duck I know that’s ridiculous. I know I’ve just gotta grow up and accept I’m inferior. / I know I’m messed up. / I know I’ve got problems. / I know… / I know I need help.
4-Hey, listen. 
4-Can we talk?
